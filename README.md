UC Berkeley Full Stack Development Project Three: Dreadit.

## What it is
A full-stack app for horror-genre lovers and ghouls to interact about anything and everything. 

## Technologies used
MERN Stack

Note to developers:
For app to function, must 1st run 'npx create-react-app client' to create 'client' folder. In the client folder, also run 'npm i jwt-decode', 'npm i --save react-router-dom', & 'npm i @apollo/client graphql'.

Then in the root, run 'npm init -y' to create a package.json 
Also in the root, run 'npm i concurrently --save-dev' to allow both client and server directory to run simultaneously

Create a server directory. In the server folder, run:
'npm init -y' to create a package.json file
'npm i graphql express apollo-server-express mongoose'

So, there'll be a total of 3 package.json files.
